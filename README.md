All roads lead to Rome but Do your Due Diligence!

Read financial annual reports via EDGAR database. Read it backwards and the 
footnotes because of the obfuscation like non-recurring charges and special 
charges that taint real earnings.

Use resources like:

https://www.morningstar.com/
https://finance.yahoo.com/

daily list of new 52-week lows
search news database
Two simple tests for management who think like owners: Are the companyâ€™s 
financial statements easily understandable, or are they full of obfuscation?
Are nonrecurring or extraordinary or unusual charges just that, or do they
have a nasty habit of recurring?

Summary of Buffettâ€™s approach: He looks for what he calls franchise companies
with strong consumer brands, easily understandable businesses, robust 
financial health, and near-monopolies in their markets, like H & R Block, 
Gillette, and the Washington Post Co. Buffett likes to snap up a stock when a
scandal, big loss, or other bad news passes over it like a storm cloud as when
he bought Coca-Cola soon after its disastrous rollout of New Coke and the
market crash of 1987. He also wants to see managers who set and meet realistic 
goals; build their businesses from within rather than through acquisition;
allocate capital wisely; and do not pay themselves hundred-million-dollar 
jackpots of stock options. Buffett insists on steady and sustainable growth in
earnings, so the company will be worth more in the future than it is today.

Be resolute in planning and executing the plans.
Focus on the best moves and ignore what the stock market is doing.

My two cents and thanks for reading!
